# CASL
Cellular Automata Scripting Language, or CASL for short, is, as you might have guessed, a scripting language for creating advanced cellular automata simulations that include multiple cells types. each cell can contain multiple rules for propagation, as well as a wide variety of parameters.

## Uses
CASL is extremely versatile, and has thousands of use cases and implementations, from actual life simulations through to terrain and level generation for videogames (see [Examples/dungeon.casl](Examples/dungeon.casl)).
