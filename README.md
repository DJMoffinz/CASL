# CASL
Cellular Automata Scripting Language, or CASL (pronounced "castle") for short is an embeddable scripting language for creating advanced GPU-accelerated cellular automata simulations. each cell can contain multiple rules for propagation, as well as a wide variety of parameters.

## Design goals
CASL aims to be:
- Functional
- Embeddable
- Easy to use
- Versatile
- Performant
When I originally had the idea for CASL I knew much less about computers and programming than I do now. From memory, the partial examples found in the [`Examples`](Examples) folder were based on Lua and BASIC, however CASL's design will probably draw much more from C and Haskell going forward.
